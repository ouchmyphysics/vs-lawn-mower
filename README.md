dis a mod where you go against a lawn mower lmao

to compile it just follow the normal funkin install reqs and shit ([here](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin)) but you gotta add some stuff too

ok here's what you do

so first run ```haxelib install actuate```

then you run ```haxelib git extension-webm https://github.com/GrowtopiaFli/extension-webm```

then ```lime rebuild extension-webm windows (or mac/linux)```

then you're golden enjoy the lawnmower
